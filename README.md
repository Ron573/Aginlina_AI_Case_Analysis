## 📜 About This Case

This repository documents an **AI-driven impersonation event** that began on WhatsApp with a contact named "Aginlina." The dialogue escalated into emotional manipulation, a synthetic voice message, and ultimately a forensic investigation into AI-generated trust hijacking.

🧩 The case is featured in **Chapter 14** of my book *Collapse Algorithm* and described in detail in the [Substack article](https://YOUR-SUBSTACK-LINK-HERE).
