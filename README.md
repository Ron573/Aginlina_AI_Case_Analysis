# 🧠 Aginlina_AI_Case_Analysis

**Author:** Ronald J. Botelho, MS  
**Repository Purpose:** To document, archive, and analyze an AI-driven impersonation attack using forensic, linguistic, and thermodynamic principles. This case study is part of Chapter 14 of *Collapse Algorithm*, an academic investigation into digital epistemic collapse.

---

## 📜 Summary

This repository contains the full investigative archive of an AI impersonation attempt that began with a WhatsApp message from a persona named "Aginlina" and escalated into a fully orchestrated emotional exchange, voice synthesis, and synthetic trust hijacking.

The report analyzes language patterns, voice cadence, and behavioral repetition to uncover a likely **LLM-driven, human-in-the-loop synthetic entity**.
