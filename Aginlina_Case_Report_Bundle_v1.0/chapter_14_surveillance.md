## Box 14.3 — Aginlina: A Synthetic Persona Built for Emotional Coercion

In June 2025, I encountered a highly sophisticated AI-driven profile through WhatsApp. The persona escalated from polite pleasantries to affection-laced manipulation and eventually deployed a deepfaked voice message.

### Forensic Observations

- Punctuation-aligned pauses suggest a TTS engine
- Absence of vocal artifacts implies lab-generated audio
- Language cues optimized to mimic attachment and trust

Upon confrontation, the persona employed guilt-laced rebuttals, likely from pre-scripted LLM prompts. The exchange terminated with message deletion and full disappearance of the profile.

This is not a theoretical event — it is real, archived, and now embedded in this manuscript as evidence.
